                Hello, I'm Lucas Pereira da Silva and I'm a front-end developer!
                I'm currently studying Systems Analysis and Development, and I
                also hold a Bachelor's degree in Automotive Engineering from the
                University of Bras√≠lia (UnB). I have about a year and a half of
                experience in web development, mainly focusing on front-end
                technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm skilled in JavaScript, React, and Angular, and I have a
                strong grasp of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
                I've worked in a agile team using Scrum and Kanban, which helped
                me sharpen my collaboration and delivery skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                I love blending my engineering background with my passion for
                coding, always looking for new challenges to tackle and ways to
                grow as a developer. Let's create something amazing together!
              </p>
